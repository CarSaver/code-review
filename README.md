# Welcome to the CarSaver Code Review Project!

First off, congratulations! You've made it to the next level of our hiring process.

This is a fairly bare-bones Spring Boot application. Some mistakes have intentionally been introduced. Some may have been unintentionally introduced (we're only human ðŸ¤· ). 

The application can be run in all the usual ways:

- `mvn spring-boot:run`

- `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

- An IDE that makes you feel comfortable and productive

Keep an eye out for code smells, potential errors, code style inconsistencies etc.  The point of this code review 
exercise is to **spawn conversation**, not necessarily to test your abilities or to "find all the bugs".  Some things
you may find are subjective, and that's okay.  We'd love to hear your opinion on those things.

Also, If you'd like, you can attempt to fix the problems you see using a Pull Request. This is not required but might provide a good framework for our conversation.
